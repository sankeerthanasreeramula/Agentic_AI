# Agentic AI
## What are AI Agents? 
- Generative AI is great for generating content like text, images, etc. 
- Agentic AI goes a step further --- it understands, generates content and also performs actions.
- Definition: - Agentic AI is an artificial intelligence system that can perform a specific goal with limited supervision. It consists of AI agents – machine learning models that mimic human decision-making to solve problems in real time. 

###### Comparision 
- Traditional programming --- Needed code to operate.
- Traditional ML --- Needed for feature engineering.
- Deep Learning --- Needed task-specific training.
- ChatGPT --- Could reason across tasks and respond without training.
- This is known as zero-shot learning or in-context learning (understands tasks just from instructions). 
Now, after some time it is developed like talking and generating from the AI is ok. But what if the AI could do those tasks/things itself? 
Here, Agentic AI comes into the picture. And Agents are introduced to do those tasks. 
For example, 
- Instead of just giving you email content, it could also send you the email.
- Instead of suggesting a product to a user, could it automatically customize the landing page? 
## What are the advantages of Agentic AI? 
- Autonomous
- Proactive
- Specialized
- Adaptable
- Intuitive 
## How does Agentic AI work? 
- There are different frameworks to work with Agentic AI in a better way. We can also perform Agentic AI without having those frameworks, but with the LLMs it could be difficult to manage memory, and knowledge source, etc., Agentic AI tools can take many forms and different frameworks are better suited to different problems, but here are the general steps that agentic systems take to perform their operations.
- Perception: Agentic AI begins by collecting data from sources i.e., from the environment through sensors, databases, APIs, or user interactions. This step ensures the system has up-to-data information to analyze and act upon.
- Reasoning: Once the data is collected, the AI processes it to extract meaningful insights. Using NLP, Computer vision or other AI capabilities, it interprets user's queries, detects patterns, and understands the broader context.
- Goal setting: It sets objectives based on predefined goals or user inputs. It then develops a strategy to achieve these goals
- Decision-making: After setting the goal, the AI evaluates multiple possible actions and chooses the optimized one based on factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and predicted outcomes.
- Execution: After selecting an action, the AI executes it.
- Learning and Adaptation: After execution, it takes feedback from the user and learns it and adapts it for improving further decisions. Through reinforcement learning or self-supervised learning, the AI refines its strategies over time, making it more effective in handling similar tasks in the future.
- Orchestration: AI orchestration is the coordination and management of systems and agents. Orchestration platforms automate AI workflows, track progress toward task completion, manage resource usage, monitor data flow and memory, and handle failure events. With the right architecture, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of agents could theoretically work together in harmonious productivity. 
## How do Agents take action? 
This works with the help of tools.
Most agents are paired with APIs, function calls, or plugins that let them interact with external systems.
The LLM doesn’t just respond with text --- it outputs structured commands like: 
Call the send_email() function with the following inputs… 
Fetch records from the CRM using this query…
Schedule a meeting for Tuesday at 2PM… 
This works because of a mechanism called tool use (or function calling). 
More Advanced Agents include: 
Memory 
Planning modules 
State management
